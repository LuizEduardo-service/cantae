# Cantaê — Project State

## Decisions

### AD-001 — Clean Architecture 4-layer split with domain purity rule
**Decision:** The project is structured as four strict layers: `presentation/`, `domain/`, `data/`, `infrastructure/`. The `domain/` layer must have zero imports of `package:flutter`, any plugin, or any network library.
**Enforced by:** `scripts/check_layers.py --root .` — exits 1 on any violation.
**Rationale:** Domain logic must be independently testable without the Flutter SDK. This is the core architectural invariant that makes the audio business rules portable and verifiable.

### AD-002 — Result<S, F> as domain error pattern; no throw in domain
**Decision:** All domain functions return `Result<S, F extends Failure>`. No `throw` statements anywhere under `lib/domain/`. Failures carry a typed `Failure` subclass with a non-empty `code` string.
**Rationale:** Exceptions cross layer boundaries invisibly. `Result` makes error paths explicit in the type system, forcing callers to handle failures at compile time.

---

### AD-003 — pyenv local 3.12.3 for Python scripts
**Decision:** The project pins Python 3.12.3 via `.python-version`. All Python scripts (layer check, spec validation) are invoked as `python scripts/check_layers.py` from the project root.
**Rationale:** Consistent Python version prevents `pyenv: no version set` errors across environments.

---

### AD-004 — All MVP dependencies declared in pubspec.yaml from Phase 0
**Decision:** `pubspec.yaml` declares all runtime and dev dependencies from Phase 0, including dependencies not used until Phase 4 (`just_audio`, `audio_service`, `nsd`).
**Rationale:** Late dependency additions risk version conflicts after the lock file is established. Declaring everything up front catches incompatibilities early, when they're cheap to fix.

---

### AD-005 — E2E tests preferred; unit tests only failure-first before code
**Decision:** E2E tests are the primary verification mechanism. Unit tests are only written when testing a system in isolation, and only when: (1) failure modes are listed first, (2) tests are written before the implementation.
**Rationale:** Post-hoc unit tests are low-signal — they describe existing behavior rather than guarding against regressions that E2E tests would catch. Failure-first isolation tests prevent testing the wrong thing.

## Handoff

_No active handoff — Phase 0 (Foundation Setup) in progress on branch `feat/phase-0-foundation-setup`._
