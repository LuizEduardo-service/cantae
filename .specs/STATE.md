# Cantaê — Project State

## Decisions

### AD-001 — Clean Architecture 4-layer split with domain purity rule
**Decision:** The project is structured as four strict layers: `presentation/`, `domain/`, `data/`, `infrastructure/`. The `domain/` layer must have zero imports of `package:flutter`, any plugin, or any network library.
**Enforced by:** `scripts/check_layers.py --root .` — exits 1 on any violation.
**Rationale:** Domain logic must be independently testable without the Flutter SDK. This is the core architectural invariant that makes the audio business rules portable and verifiable.

---

### AD-002 — Result<S, F> as domain error pattern; no throw in domain
**Decision:** All domain functions return `Result<S, F extends Failure>`. No `throw` statements anywhere under `lib/domain/`. Failures carry a typed `Failure` subclass with a non-empty `code` string.
**Rationale:** Exceptions cross layer boundaries invisibly. `Result` makes error paths explicit in the type system, forcing callers to handle failures at compile time.

---

### AD-003 — pyenv local 3.12.3 for Python scripts
**Decision:** The project pins Python 3.12.3 via `.python-version`. All Python scripts (layer check, spec validation) are invoked as `python scripts/check_layers.py` from the project root.
**Rationale:** Consistent Python version prevents `pyenv: no version set` errors across environments.

---

### AD-004 — All MVP dependencies declared in pubspec.yaml from Phase 0
**Decision:** `pubspec.yaml` declares all runtime and dev dependencies from Phase 0, including dependencies not used until Phase 4 (`just_audio`, `audio_service`, `nsd`).
**Rationale:** Late dependency additions risk version conflicts after the lock file is established. Declaring everything up front catches incompatibilities early, when they're cheap to fix.

---

### AD-005 — E2E tests preferred; unit tests only failure-first before code
**Decision:** E2E tests are the primary verification mechanism. Unit tests are only written when testing a system in isolation, and only when: (1) failure modes are listed first, (2) tests are written before the implementation.
**Rationale:** Post-hoc unit tests are low-signal — they describe existing behavior rather than guarding against regressions that E2E tests would catch. Failure-first isolation tests prevent testing the wrong thing.

---

### AD-006 — const constructors on all domain entities
**Decision:** All domain entity constructors are `const`. Assert conditions use `field.length > 0` (integer comparison) rather than `field.isNotEmpty` for compile-time const compatibility.
**Rationale:** `const` entities allow fixtures and tests to be evaluated at compile time, and is required for the `prefer_const_constructors` lint rule to pass. Tests that intentionally trigger invalid-input asserts omit `const` and add `// ignore: prefer_const_constructors`.

---

### AD-007 — Flutter SDK path: D:\flutter\bin
**Decision:** Flutter SDK lives at `D:\flutter\bin` (user-level PATH, not system PATH). Automation shells must prepend this to PATH before invoking `flutter`.
**Rationale:** Flutter is installed under the user profile, not a system-wide location, so it is absent from the automation shell's inherited PATH.

## Handoff

Phase 1 (Audio Domain) complete and verified on branch `feat/phase-1-audio-domain`.
- 72 domain tests passing (all of `test/domain/`)
- `flutter analyze`: 0 issues
- Layer purity: clean (`check_layers.py`)
- Verifier: PASS — 39/39 ACs, 4/4 mutations killed

**Next:** merge `feat/phase-1-audio-domain` → `develop`, then start Phase 2 (Local Persistence — SQLite schema, library repo, CRUD).
